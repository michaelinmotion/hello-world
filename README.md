===========

I'm a creative writer, and I want to use Git to write a novel. GitHub seems to be the way to have my work version controlled and also backed up away from my laptop, but I'm not sure if I want it to be public. I certainly don't want it to be edited by other people. Perhaps a private repository would work for me.

I don't know what I'm doing yet.
